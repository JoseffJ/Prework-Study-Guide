Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- For this project I wanted to learn how to use HTML,CSS and JavaScript and further understand what is going on behind the uder interface. I built this project ot understand the basics of what coding and designing a website actually is all about. This study guide project has all the information I learned throughout the course into one cohesive page. I learned it can take multiple languages working together to make a functioning webapage. I learned a lot about GitHub and its processes to fully intergrate your work with the internet as a whole. I also learned you have to slow down and remeber that every little counts towards fully designing and completeing a porject.

## Usage

Each section contains the notes from what I learned throughout the course. It lists information about HTML,CSS,JavaScript, and Git and how you need to use all of them together to make a fully designed webpage, and in the DevTools console, we can see Javascript running. It lists the topics from prework and chooses one topic for us to study first.
